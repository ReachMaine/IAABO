		PRE-REGULAR SEASON MEMO</h1>
		<h2 align="center"><b>December 2014</b></h2>
		<h3><b>Rule	Change	9.1.3</b> </h3>
		<p>Players	in	free	throw	lane	line	marked	spaces	may	enter	the	free	throw	lane	upon	
the	release	of	the	ball	by	the	free	thrower.
Officials	must	be	vividly	aware	of	the	following:
</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Free	throw	lane	line	player’s	foot/feet,	prior	to	the	release	of	the	ball,	may	not	break	the	
outside	plane	of	the	free	throw	lane	line.		A	violation	may	occur	–	penalize.
			</li>
			<li>A	player	who	breaks	the	outside	edge/plane	of	the	<b>free	throw	line</b>	with	a	foot/feet,	prior	to	the	
ball	contacting	the	backboard	or	basket	ring,	has	committed	a	VIOLATION.		Display	the	delay	
signal	(arm	extended	with	a	closed	fist)	and	if	the	free	throw	is	not	successful,	sound	the	
whistle,	explain	the	violation,	and	then	administer	a	new	free	throw.
			</li>
			<li>Based	upon	history,	there	will	be	considerable	more	action	within	the	free	throw	lane.	Monitor	
the	play	closely	and	penalize	illegal	contact.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>
<b>New	Rule	Addition	10.6.12 </b>(CONTACT)– </h3>
		<p>
A	continued	major	concern	about	illegal	contact	and	the	need	
for	enforcement	of	the	rules	pertaining	to <b>contact	by	the	defense	and	offense	once	again	has	been	
addressed. </b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Rule	10.6	(contact)	is	directed	at	all	contact	situation.	It	is	not	simply	about	the	defense	or	the	
offense,	it	is	about	both.		It	is	not	simply	about	the	ball	handler/dribbler,	it	is	about	all	situations	
and	players	located	anywhere	on	the	court	(review	rule	10.1	through	11	and	past	points	of	
emphasis).</li>
			<li>Enforce	the	rule	governing	contact	and	all	other	rules.	While	doing	so,	have	no	regard	for	the	
score	of	the	game,	the	time	of	the	game	or	any	team	or	player	situations. 
			</li>
			<li>The	rules	are	not	more	concerned	about	the	defense’s	contact	than	it	is	about	the	offense’s	
contact.	 Example:	A	offensive	player	bumping/jumping	into/backing	into	an	opponent	,	is	to	
ruled	as	illegal	just	as	the	bumping,/jumping	into/leaning	on	an	opponent,	by	the	defensive, is	to	
be	ruled	as	illegal.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>
Other	Rules	Needing	Attention/Improvement</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Coaching	Box	marks	and	the	“X”	at	the	Division	Line	in	front	of	the Table</b>,	must	be	in	place	prior	to	
the	game	beginning. </li>
			<li><b>The	Coaching	Box	rule</b>	is	not	to	be	treated	differently	than	all	other	rules.	The	rule	needs	appropriate	
attention	and	is	to	be	enforced.		The	rule	and	the	schools	expect	enforcement	of	illegal	movement	
and/or	behavior.		The	rules	do	not	allow	for	WARNING. </li>
			<li><b>Dunking	is	legal.</b>	Upon	dunking,	a	player’s finger(s),	hand,	or	forearm	may	be	in	contact	with	the	basket	
ring.		The	finger(s),	hand	or	forearm	contact	will	not	break	down	the	basket	ring.	However,	grasping	
(closing	fingers	around	the	basket	ring)	will	and	does	break	down	the	basket	ring,	it	is	ILLEGAL.	 Always,	
penalize	such	action.
<br>
			Maine	officiating	must	not	have	some	official	penalizing,	Grasping	and	others	not	penalizing	it. 
			</li>
			<li><b>Palming</b>	is	the	ending	of	a	dribble.		A	player	attempting	to	dribble	behind	the	back	cannot	be	allowed	
to	have	the	ball	come	to	rest	in	the	hand	and	then	throw/begin	a	second	dribble	=	illegal/double	dribble. 
			</li>
			<li><b>Traveling: </b>Situations needing more attention and improved 
			rulings; 1) post player with back to basket often mini-jumps, then 
			releases the ball to dribble (traveling) which enhances the result 
			of the overall move; 2) a player in transition, receiving a pass 
			from a rebounder/teammate and does not handle the ball properly, 
			resulting in the pivot foot being lifted prior to the ball being 
			released to begin a dribble . Usually this overall movement appears 
			fluid and athletic. However, it is a traveling violation and must be 
			ruled as such. Simply stated, in order to make accurate traveling 
			rulings, the official must first IDENTIFY the pivot foot. </li>
			<li><b>Substitute(s)	&	Procedure:</b> 
			<ol>
				<li>By	rule substitute(s)	are	not	to	be	beckoned	into	play	prior	to	the	HORN	
sounding.		Honor	the	Table	officials.		</li>
				<li>The	MAINE	mechanic	is	when	a	throw-in	or	free	throw	is	
involved,	is	ONLY	the	official	administering	the	throw-in	or	free	throw	shall	admit substitute(s). 
				Doing this eliminates illegal substitution, as only the 
				administering official knows when the ball is about to become 
				live. </li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li><b>Time-Out:</b> 
			<ol>
				<li>The time-out procedure is, if possible recognize/identify 
				the REQUEST, then if possible CHECK to learn if the request can 
				be GRANTED, and then GRANT or do not GRANT the REQUEST; </li>
				<li>There are time-out request situations that can’t be 
				recognized/identified nor granted. </li>
				<li>An official who is away from the location of the ball and 
				near a Head Coach is very often guilty of illegally granting a 
				time-out. </li>
				<li>A reminder that there MUST be Player Control, when the ball 
				is live and in play, prior to granting a time-out. </li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li><b>3-Point	Try	Situations,</b>	see	the	entire	play	-	“Shooter”	and	defender	up	and	down.		“Shooter”	back	on	
the	floor	is	no	longer	in	the	act	of	shooting;	“Shooter”	not	back	on	floor	and	fouled	–	if	successful,	1	free	
throw;	if	not	successful,	3	free	throws.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>
Mechanics	&	Signals	Needing	Attention/Improvement</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Announcers	are	to	be	included	i</b>n	the	Referee’s	pre-game	Table	instructions….	
			<ol>
				<li>Referee,	introduce	
self/meet	the	announcer;		</li>
				<li>Ask	–	Are	you	aware	of	the	standards	expected	of	the	announcer	and	
announcements?	</li>
				<li>Thank you, enjoy the game</li>
				<li>From that point on, the Athletic Director will address the 
				announcer if there should be a need to do so </li>
				<li>Move	on	to	the	Scorer	&	Timer. </li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li><b>At	the	Site	of	Foul	&	Reporting	the	Foul </b>–	See	&	Review IAABO	Manual	pages	52	&	53.
			</li>
			<li><b>At	the	Site	of	Violation </b>–	See	&	Review IAABO	Manual	page	36.</li>
			<li><b>Crew	of 2	&	Quarter	Intermissions –</b>	At	game	sites	when	there	are	no	cheerleaders,
the	Umpire	may	be	positioned		in	front	of	the	center	restraining	circle,	as	per IAABO	Manual	page	88,	
and	facing	the	Table.		This	positioning	is	more	practical	for	informing	both	teams	of	the	first	horn.
			</li>
			<li><b>Color		-		</b>When	signaling	a	direction,	always,	simultaneously	announce	the	COLOR.	Do	so	when	ruling	a	
violation,	beginning	a	quarter,	after	a	time-out,	Intentional	foul	throw-in,	Technical	Foul	throw-in,	
following	a	delay.	etc. </li>
			<li><b>Designated	Spot </b>–	Official	always	begins	at	the	side	of	the	thrower-in;		signal	the	designated	sport,	
then	may	hand	or	bounce	pass	the	ball	to	the	thrower.		Signaling	is	not	a	“secret”,	it	matters	to	all 10	
players. </li>
			<li><b>Stop	the	Clock	Signal,</b>	every	time	the	whistle	is	sounded.		Upon	stopping	the	clock,	don’t hurry	the	
signal	down.		Hold	the	signal	and	make	eye	contact	with	a partner(s)	prior	to	further	signaling	and/or	
movement.	
			</li>
			<li><b>Lead	Official –</b> 
			<ol>
				<li>Give	up	the	ball	when	it	leaves	your PCA.	Trust	partner(s),	don’t	ball	watch.	
				</li>
				<li>Be	
positioned	wide	toward	the	3-point	line	and	the endline	intersection	when	the	ball	is	on	Lead’s	side	of	
the	basketline;		</li>
				<li>Never	turn	your	head	toward	the	near	sideline,	doing	so	is	an	indication	that	you	are	
not	wide	enough.		</li>
				<li>There	is	no	“magic	spot”,	move	to	improve	the	coverage. 
				</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li><b>Trail	Official/Trail	&	Center	Officials –</b> 
			<ol>
				<li>Position	wise,	get	into	the	game;	</li>
				<li>Be	aware	of PCA,	FOV	
Cones	and	A,B,C	 coverage	concepts;		</li>
				<li>Prior	to	releasing	after	a	try	for	goal,	successful	or	unsuccessful,	
remain/stay	and	read	the	situation. </li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li><b>Overtime	Meeting		–	</b>
			<ol>
				<li>Referee, invite Captains &amp; Head Coaches; </li>
				<li>inform – 4 minutes, 1 additional 60-second time-out; may use 
				remaining time-outs, AP Arrow to be reset; begin with jump ball, 
				teams going in same direction; </li>
				<li>Instruct Timer to start the 1 minute intermission; </li>
				<li>Instruct the Scorer &amp; Timer of overtime factors. </li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li><b>The	Officials’	Role	Does	Not	Include Being	Anti-Head	Coach</b>,	however;		
			<ol>
				<li>Don’t	delay	the	game	to	talk	
with	a	coach,	the	other	team	wants	to	play	and	play	must	continue;		
				</li>
				<li>Don’t	be	positioned	near	a	Head	
Coach,	during	dead	ball	time	or	free	throws,	unless	it	is	absolutely	necessary.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Officials	are	not	to	wear	any	form	of	jewelry.	As	with	players,	arms	and	hands	are	moving	throughout	
the	game	and	the	risk	of	injury	is	present. </li>
		</ul>
		<h3>
OTHER</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Send	Technical	Foul	Report	Form	to	Board	Interpreter	and	copy	the	Commissioner.</li>
			<li>Report	any	unusual	incident	to	the	Board	Interpreter	and	copy	the	Commissioner.
			</li>
			<li>Send	Ejection	Report	to	Board	Interpreter	and	copy	Commissioner.		Make	a	personal	telephone	call	to	
the	Interpreter,	not	later	than	8:00	AM	the	following	day.</li>
			<li>Keep	in	mind	that	we	are	servicing	sport	within	education	and	the	school	administration	is	depending	
upon	the	crew	of	officials	to	assist	in	ensuring	the	experience	is	positive	and	beneficial.
			</li>
			<li>There	are	two	teams	and	each	team	is	affected	by	each	and	every	situation.		Each	ruling,	legal	or	illegal,
MATTERS	to	both	teams.
			</li>
			<li>Hopefully,	the	goal	of	each	Maine IAABO	official	is	to	be	improved	over	the	2013-14	season.</li>
