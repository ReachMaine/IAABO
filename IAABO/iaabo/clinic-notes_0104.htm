        <blockquote>
<p><b>Uniforms / Equipment</b></p>
<ul type="square">
	<li>Continue to enforce, direct to leave game if not complying with shirts 
	being tucked in. (Wait until all duties have been completed on next dead 
	ball and once ball is ready to be put in play if player has not tucked in 
	their shirt then ask for a substitute)</li>
	<li>Undergarments, which are compression shorts or tights, includes Under 
	Armour type wear, must be predominant color of pant / skirt and cannot be 
	below knee or below pant / skirt. If players insist to roll pants over at 
	waist make sure manufacturer’s label does not show.</li>
	<li>Compression sleeves must be for medical reasons</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Rough Play</b></p>
<ul type="square">
	<li>Don’t allow displacement, bumping cutters, backing down, swim strokes or 
	hooking</li>
	<li>Piling on for a loose ball should be ruled a foul, not a jump ball. 
	Also, in trying to secure a loose ball there may be incidental contact but 
	don’t ignore illegal contact that puts one player at a disadvantage of 
	getting to the loose ball.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Time-outs</b></p>
<ul type="square">
	<li>Make sure to identify the source and the request then check to see if 
	there is player control. Be sure to indicate the throw-in spot immediately 
	after recognizing the time-out. Remember an Interval of Time is not to be 
	treated the same as a time-out.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Slapping the Backboard</b></p>
<ul type="square">
	<li>We have been penalizing due to technical fouls turned in, good job ! It 
	can be a legal act but don’t allow as an act of frustration or bringing 
	attention to oneself.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Closely Guarded</b></p>
<ul type="square">
	<li>Know what 6’ is, (distance from top of arc to foul line), may be 
	changing counting arms continuously in some situations. Count ends when 
	dribbler has head &amp; shoulders by defender. Just because a player is moving 
	towards the basket does not terminate the count if they have not beaten the 
	defender.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Free throw lane</b></p>
<ul type="square">
	<li>Remember, feet cannot break the plane. Eliminate players having arms out 
	in front of opponent before putting ball at disposal of free thrower. Don’t 
	allow players to step in behind opponent before ball hits the rim.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Traveling</b></p>
<ul type="square">
	<li>There is always need for improvement with this ruling. If it is so close 
	that you need a video replay to determine if there was a travel then it 
	probably is a good indication that we should pass on a call. Remember, a 
	jump stop must be simultaneous landing on both feet with no ability to 
	pivot. Identify the pivot foot, don’t allow step backs or throughs that move 
	the pivot foot.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Continuous motion</b></p>
<ul type="square">
	<li>Must be a foul by the defender to apply. Foul may not be on the shooter 
	but continuous motion would still apply.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Interrupted Dribble</b></p>
<ul type="square">
	<li>If dribbler steps on boundary line during interrupted dribble it is not 
	a violation as it is if player is in control, dribbling. ( Does not have to 
	be touching ball when dribbling and stepping on line)</li>
	<li>Wrong # in book is a technical foul but not charged to the head coach as 
	an indirect as is an illegal # or uniform</li>
	<li>When notifying the coach of loss of coaching box after a direct or 
	indirect technical foul, even though the Manual indicates it is the 
	Referee’s responsibility, it may be best to have the non-calling official 
	handle this duty so as not to aggravate the situation anymore.</li>
	<li>Intentional fouls must be called if there is no attempt to play the 
	ball. Time remaining in game has no bearing, if player is not playing the 
	ball then an intentional foul is suspect.</li>
	<li>Don’t initiate talk with coaches. Answer questions then move on. Stay 
	away from coaches during touchy situations, don’t agitate the problem 
	anymore.</li>
	<li>Be professional in all that you do, from your dress and appearance, to 
	early arrival at game site, to greetings and talking to coaches prior to 
	changing up. We are the integrity of the game, don’t diminish that ! Always 
	work hard no matter what the situation and don’t ever feel that our duties 
	are easy and taken for granted. We are always learning and can improve.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Two Person Mechanics Needing Attention</b></p>
<ul type="square">
	<li>During pre-game conference be sure to touch on these touchy areas;<ol>
		<li>Far sideline above free throw line extended.</li>
		<li>End line A, B, C positions and closing down.</li>
		<li>Presses and spread offense</li>
		<li>Out of bounds near division line in transition</li>
		<li>PCA’s and calling out of PCA</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Use the bounce pass to improve angles and field of vision.</li>
	<li>As Trail on free throws, don’t be too deep. 2/3 of way to sideline and 
	one step behind free throw line extended. Know people responsible for 
	watching and don’t leave until ball hits rim then step towards end line. Be 
	aware of those outside the arc. Lead stay out of visual field of shooter. 
	May help to see people responsible for by being up to boundary line instead 
	of off the end line.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Three Person Comments</b></p>
<ul type="square">
	<li>Be sure to close down and ready to rotate when ball is on other side of 
	basket line</li>
	<li>If Center has pressure deep on their side in front court then the Lead 
	should rotate to release the Center to the Trail position.</li>
	<li>Lead be sure to watch play over shoulder in transition and help with 
	side line boundary calls.</li>
	<li>Center take a major role in cross court calls in transition.</li>
	<li>Lead be sure to stay wide when ball is on your side of basket line.</li>
	<li>Trail will have responsibility for most back court violation calls.</li>
