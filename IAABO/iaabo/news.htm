        <p align="left">MILLINOCKET – Peter H. Walls, 75, passed away on July 
		13, 2014 after a brief illness. He was predeceased by his mother and 
		father, Viola and George (Pat) Walls; a sister, Lucille Gallant and a 
		brother, Paul Albert. He is survived by 2 nephews, Michael Gallant and 
		his wife, Sherry, and John Gallant and his wife Beth and 3 nieces, 
		Connie Cleaves and her husband, Art, Susan Albert and her husband, Lynn, 
		and Sally Osborne and her husband, Kenny.<br>
		<br>
		Peter was an avid sports fan. During Peter’s younger years, he was a 
		player/coach for the Emerson Pills and Bartlett’s Five, semi-pro 
		basketball teams. He brought a lot of that enthusiasm to the children of 
		Millinocket. For many years he coached Little Giant Football and Pee Wee 
		Basketball. He attended high school basketball, baseball and football 
		games on a regular basis. He was even the announcer for the Stearns 
		basketball games on television. Mostly, Peter loved to referee 
		basketball games throughout Eastern Maine. He touched many people during 
		those years, kids and fans alike. Then he would change his hat and 
		become a softball umpire for the season. Many times he would come home 
		with a sunburn but never complained because he was doing what he liked 
		to do best, being involved in sports.<br>
		<br>
		Peter worked for the Great Northern Paper Company in the QA Department. 
		He was a life member of the B.P.O.E Lodge # 1521 Elks. He was an “old 
		time” Celtics fan, a Green Bay Packers fan, and a lifelong New York 
		Yankees fan. Traveling to the college hockey “frozen four” for many 
		years, he got to visit many states in the U.S. Peter enjoyed attending 
		the July 4th Little Italy Goomba’s with many close friends. Daily rides 
		around town and visiting with friends at the Scootic In and Elks was 
		what made Peter happy.<br>
		<br>
		Peter will be greatly missed by all of us but especially his longtime 
		friend, Bill Thorpe, who was his “partner in crime” for many of the 
		travelling adventures. Dave, Nancy and Sean DeWitt were like an extended 
		family to him. He was Sean’s Santa for many years, leaving notes and 
		signing the gift tags on Christmas Eve. RIP, Uncle Pete. We love you.<br>
		<br>
		There will be a CELEBRATION OF LIFE for Peter, 2 p.m. Aug. 3, 2014 at 
		the Millinocket Elks Hall. Donations in Pete’s memory may be sent to the 
		Peter Walls Memorial Athletic Scholarship Fund, c/o Stearns High School, 
		P.O. Box 30, Millinocket, ME 04462. Arrangements are by Lamson Funeral 
		Home. Messages of condolence may be expressed at www.lamsonfh.com.</td>
