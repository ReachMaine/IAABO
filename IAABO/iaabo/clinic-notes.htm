			<ul type="square">
				<li>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: -15px; margin-left: 15px">				Regarding sliding on the floor and rolling over. Momentum cannot 
				cause a player to travel, but once momentum stops a player is 
				only allowed to sit up from a back prone position. If a player 
				rolls from back to side, side to back or stomach to side or back 
				it should be ruled a travel. Also a player cannot get up to one 
				foot or knee after being on the floor unless they start a 
				dribble first. Placing the ball on the floor, standing up and 
				then picking up the ball is also considered a travel.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: -15px; margin-left: 15px">				Remember that we are trying to be inclusive as much as is 
				reasonable in allowing players to participate. Such things as 
				paint or make-up on a players face due to a play or show they 
				were in prior to the game and due to extenuating circumstances 
				the material cannot be washed off properly in time for the game, 
				we should do the right thing and allow the players to 
				participate. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: -15px; margin-left: 15px">				Balls going in the basket from outside the arc that were not 
				tries, goals or throws for the basket and the official is sure 
				it was a pass or deflection should count only 2 points.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: -15px; margin-left: 15px">				Speak to scorers or timers that are using cell phones to text 
				during the game. They are part of the officiating team and 
				should not be doing this. Use of cell phones by officials during 
				their jurisdiction of the game is completely unethical, shows a 
				total disrespect for the game and will not be tolerated.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: -15px; margin-left: 15px">				A teammate of the team entitled to the throw-in cannot be called 
				for interfering with the ball after a made basket. There could 
				be an unsporting technical foul called for batting the ball in 
				disgust but once the ball is available to the throw-in team then 
				the official should assume the ball is live and start a 5 second 
				count. If a teammate bats the ball away then the count would 
				continue and a 5 second violation be called.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: -15px; margin-left: 15px">				Be sure to count players during the pre-game and Referee be sure 
				that there are adequate numbers / names in the book to cover the 
				players on the floor warming up. More is OK, less we should have 
				a concern and ask the appropriate coach to check it. Try to 
				avoid a technical foul in this case by catching problems in 
				advance.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: -15px; margin-left: 15px">				Rules require that a captain be designated for each team but the 
				rules do not require a captain/s to be present at the pre-game 
				meeting. The rule does require the Head Coach to be present at 
				this meeting.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: -15px; margin-left: 15px">				Coaches request time-outs, officials grant them. Be sure that 
				the request is coming from the Head Coach or a player on the 
				floor and then make sure that there is player control so the 
				time-out can be granted. Don’t over react on time-out requests.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: -15px; margin-left: 15px">				Do not get all bent out of shape over hair control devices. As 
				long as it is controlling the hair and is not metallic or causes 
				a safety concern then color is not an issue.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: -15px; margin-left: 15px">				Referee be sure to write all officials names in the score book. 
				Especially with the coaches rating cards in use it is vital that 
				names are in the book.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: -15px; margin-left: 15px">				Make sure to beckon in substitutes when appropriate. Honor the 
				timer by waiting for the horn but make sure to beckon them in 
				once the horn is sounded. You can cover this in the captains / 
				coaches meeting reminding them to wait for the horn and be 
				beckoned before coming onto the court.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: -15px; margin-left: 15px">				Be sure to penalize players who are touching a boundary line 
				while touching the ball, particularly during a loose ball 
				scramble.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: -15px; margin-left: 15px">				Intervals of time do not allow bench personnel to be standing. 
				Only the Head Coach, players and sub coming into the game can 
				participate in an Interval of Time stoppage for replacing a 
				disqualified, injured or bleeding player. During 30 &amp; 60 second 
				time-outs all bench personnel may participate, players cannot be 
				seated during a 30 second time-out.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: -15px; margin-left: 15px">				When there is no team control, tipping / tapping the ball into 
				backcourt would not constitute a backcourt violation and 
				therefore the tipping / tapping team could go back and retrieve 
				the ball. If the ball is controlled by a player and then thrown 
				or guided into backcourt, then this would constitute a backcourt 
				violation if touched by the throwing team first in backcourt.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: -15px; margin-left: 15px">				If you direct a player to the bench for a shirt issue be sure to 
				stay with the player, making sure they tuck the shirt in and 
				keep it in while on the bench.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: -15px; margin-left: 15px">				Play Situation #1 in the latest Sportorial involves an incorrect 
				ruling and is nothing that can rectified after it occurs, it is 
				not a correctable error. Play Situation #4, the understanding 
				should be not to blow the whistle upon release of the try if the 
				player who is injured is at the other end of the floor and not 
				in further danger of being injured more. Wait until team control 
				is established by one team and then blow the whistle for 
				stoppage of play.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: -15px; margin-left: 15px">				A lesson to learn from the DeSoto Body Slam incident that was on 
				YouTube is to know where game management can be located and be 
				sure to park in a well lit and safe area.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: -15px; margin-left: 15px">				Be sure to submit technical foul reports and ejection's as soon 
				as possible after a game.</li>
