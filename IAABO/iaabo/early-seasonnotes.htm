        <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Jump Ball &amp;Toss </b>&nbsp;</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal">Start the game with an outstanding toss. The toss 
			should be higher than each player can jump. It is a violation to 
			contact the ball on the up. Both the tossing official and the 
			non-tossing official are responsible for monitoring the toss. Too 
			many games begin with a poor toss and/or a violation. As per rule, a 
			poor toss must be ruled as such and a re-toss should take place. As 
			per rule, a violation (contacting the ball on its way up) is a 
			violation. Penalize the player contacting the ball in such cases.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Free throw Coverage&nbsp;</b></p>
		<blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal">Be focused and care, monitor the play along the 
			free throw lane lines. Penalize players who refuse to comply with 
			the rules. Breaking the outside plane of the free throw lane line 
			prior to the ball contacting the ring or backboard and disconcertion 
			must be penalized. Don’t end the lane line coverage upon the release 
			of the ball by the free thrower. &nbsp;Free throws are FREE unhindered 
			attempts to score. Free of any potential distractions, enforce the 
			rule. Additionally, be aware of the offensive player in the second 
			lane space leaving the space and moving into the first space behind 
			the defensive player. Leaving a lane space prior to the ball 
			contacting the ring or backboard is a violation. Enforce the rules 
			and non-compliance will be eliminated.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Traveling Concerns</b>&nbsp;</p>
		<blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal">Jump stop landing legally then lifting a foot and 
			replacing it on the floor to protect the ball from an opponent or to 
			enhance the result of a try for goal or a pass. Ruling – traveling. 
			The official must be focused and not be caught by surprise.&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">A player, while moving, catches a pass or 
			gathers her/his dribble places a foot on the court (pivot foot) then 
			reaches out with the non-pivot foot and places it on the floor 
			followed by lifting the pivot foot and returning it to the floor to 
			begin a lay up try. Ruling – traveling. The official must be focused 
			and not caught by surprise.&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">A player, in full stride, receives a pass, with 
			a foot on the floor (pivot foot) then reaches out with the non-pivot 
			foot and places it on the floor, lifts the pivot foot and then 
			release the ball to begin a dribble. Ruling – traveling. The 
			official must be focused and not caught by surprise.&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">The above three situations occur regularly and 
			often are not ruled a violation. The movement is very fluid and 
			athletic (nice looking moves). Because they are illegal, has much to 
			do with the attractiveness and the resulting accomplishment. Had the 
			player played legally, the enhanced move could not take place and 
			chances are the result would not be greatly affected.&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Three seconds&nbsp;</b></p>
		<blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal">It has been said, “Don’t be a good three second 
			official.” Where can rule support be found for that statement? The 
			three second rule matters. This part of the game needs attention. If 
			one observes many games it will be discovered that there are many 
			instances of a player in the free throw lane for five and six 
			seconds. Negligence can permit an advantage that leads to a score.&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Closely Guarded&nbsp;</b></p>
		<blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal">Don’t be slow in applying the rule. The defense 
			is playing with the rule in mind. Any delay takes away from the 
			effort of the defense. The application of the rule and five second 
			count does not end because there is advancement toward the basket by 
			the offense. The closely guarded rule applies anywhere in the 
			frontcourt when the defense is in a legal guarding position within 
			six feet of the offensive player. The defender is not ‘beaten’ until 
			the offensive player gets head and shoulders past the front plane of 
			the defender. Until that occurs, the rule and count continues. Do 
			not signal ‘not closely guarded’ when the two involved players are 
			six feet (measured from toe to toe) or less apart.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left"><b>Palming</b>&nbsp;</p>
		<blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal">Rather than thinking in terms of “palming”, think 
			about the ending of a dribble. The dribble ends when the ball comes 
			to rest in or on a hand(s). When the dribbler causes the ball to 
			come to rest (the dribble has ended). To then push the ball to the 
			floor constitutes the beginning of a new dribble = illegal (double 
			dribble. To allow a “double dribble” creates a substantial 
			advantage.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left"><b>Contact</b>&nbsp;</p>
		<blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal">There is legal (incidental) and illegal contact. 
			All players (offense&amp; defense) are entitled, by rule, to have <b>
			freedom of movement</b>. Arm bars, bumping, backing down, hands on, 
			displacement, leaning on, holding, pushing, and illegal screens 
			prevent <b>freedom of</b> <b>movement</b>. Such contact affects the 
			player’s ability to play. Such contact is a foul and must be ruled a 
			foul. &nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">Each contact that occurs requires that the 
			official to apply the “litmus test” – did the contact affect (hinder 
			or help) the offensive player or defender? If it did not affect 
			either player’s opportunity or freedom of movement, the contact is 
			legal (incidental). If the contact did affect one of the involved 
			player’s opportunity or freedom of movement the contact is illegal 
			and must be ruled a foul. &nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">An&nbsp; example of legal contact (incidental) which 
			is often ruled a foul – late in the game an offensive player has 
			‘beaten’ the opponent and is breaking away via a dribble; the 
			defender reaches out and contacts the dribbler; the contact 
			(incidental) does not affect/hinder the offensive player’s 
			opportunity or freedom of movement; the official rules a foul even 
			though the contact is legal (incidental) contact; the ruling places 
			the offensive player at a disadvantage as he/she simply wants to 
			progress with the ball and have the clock continue to run; such a 
			ruling creates an unfair situation as it stops the clock and forces 
			the offensive team into a throw-in or free throw situation when it 
			prefers to control the ball and have the clock running.&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Dunking – Grasping the Ring</b>&nbsp;</p>
		<blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal">Dunking the ball is legal. Grasping the ring is 
			only legal when the player is preventing self injury or injury to 
			others. To dunk does not require grasping the ring and grasping is 
			not necessary to completing the act of dunking the ball. A hand(s) 
			contacting the ring will often occur when a player is dunking. To 
			dunk the ball and have a hand(s) touch/contact the ring is legal. To 
			dunk the ball a player does not need to cause the ring to break 
			down. To grasp, place fingers around the ring, is unnecessary and is 
			illegal. </p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Nearest Spot (a rule)</b>&nbsp;</p>
		<blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal">The nearest spot to the violation or foul is a 
			rule not simply a mechanic. The designated spot/nearest spot is not 
			to be determined based on the convenience of the officials. </p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

		<p><b>Palming</b></p>
		<blockquote>
          <p>Rather than thinking in terms of “palming”, think about the ending 
			of a dribble. The dribble ends when the ball comes to rest in or on 
			a hand(s).When the dribbler causes the ball to come to rest (the 
			dribble has ended). To then push the ball to the floor constitutes 
			the beginning of a new dribble = illegal (double dribble. To allow a 
			“double dribble” creates a substantial advantage.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><b>Contact</b></p>
		<blockquote>
          <p>There is legal (incidental) and illegal contact. All players 
			(offense&amp; defense) are entitled, by rule, to have freedom of 
			movement. Arm bars, bumping, backing down, hands on, displacement, 
			leaning on, holding, pushing, and illegal screens prevent freedom of

			An example of legal contact (incidental) which is often ruled a foul

		<p><b>Intentional Fouls</b></p>
		<blockquote>
          <p>Far too often, officials do not rule fouls as intentional when the 
			act clearly meets the criteria for an intentional foul. The 
			intentional foul has devolved into misapplication and personal 
			interpretation. The defensive team is given an unwarranted advantage 
			if an intentional foul is not ruled when committed. Intentional 
			fouls may occur at anytime during the game.</p>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Some things to look for are:</li>
				<li>Any foul which is not a legitimate attempt to play the ball</li>
				<li>Grabbing a player’s arm, body without initially attempting 
				to gain control of the ball</li>
				<li>Any holding, pushing or grabbing the player away from the 
				ball</li>
				<li>Grabbing a player’s uniform</li>
				<li>Wrapping the arm(s) around a player</li>
				<li>Pushing/grabbing a player from behind before the act of 
				shooting starts when an apparent easy basket may be scored</li>
				<li>An obvious attempt to stop the clock to neutralize the 
				opponents obvious advantageous position by forcing the opponent 
				into a throw-in or free throw-in situation.</li>
