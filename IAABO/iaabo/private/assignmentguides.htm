			<p align="left">Boys and Girls varsity secondary basketball teams in 
			the Board 111 area (Hancock, Penobscot, Piscataquis, Knox and Waldo 
			Counties) that are to be officiated by Board 111 members must have 
			their complete schedule of home varsity games assigned by Board 111. 
			Per the Maine State Basketball Council, only Board 111 officials may 
			work varsity games within the territory described above unless 
			agreed upon by the Basketball Council in advance of the MPA 
			basketball season or in emergency as determined by the assignor for 
			Board 111.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left">Sub-varsity assigned dates will be made only after 
			varsity games are assigned and only to the point that officials are 
			available. Freshman and JV games must have Board 111 certified 
			officials to comply with the MPA contract.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left">Officials of Board 111 may accept varsity secondary 
			school games from outside Board 111’s area only after receiving 
			varsity assignments as listed on the current assignment 
			communication system, <a href="http://www.arbitersports.com">
			ArbiterSports.com</a>. Varsity dates will appear by Nov 1st of each 
			year on your Arbiter site as denoted in light blue on your calendar, 
			with a notice posted by the assigner that the dates have been 
			posted. Boys and Girls junior varsity secondary games, freshman 
			games and middle school games may not be accepted by Board 111 
			officials until their sub-varsity assignments have been released in 
			November. Once officials have accepted assigned games, they are free 
			to accept games from “outside” the Board 111 assignment program 
			assuming they update their availability calendar on
			<a href="http://www.arbitersports.com">ArbiterSports.com</a>.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left">Schools outside of Board 111’s area may request 
			Board 111’s assignor to assign officials to their school for a 
			limited number of games or they may contact the officials directly 
			to hire them. It is recommended that Board 111 officials work 
			together on any games assigned outside of Board 111’s assignment 
			program. Board 111 officials may not accept games from outside the 
			assignment program if they have already been assigned the date by 
			Board 111.</li>

			than four varsity games (two home and two away) for any one 
			boys/girls team unless deemed an emergency situation by the 
			assigner.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left">The assigner should avoid scheduling officials to 
			games that result in back to back situations with one school. Back 
			to back is considered two consecutive games, home or away, for one 
			official involving the same team.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left">The assigner will request from all schools in the 
			Board 111 area the schedule of games to be assigned. Schools will be 
			asked to block any official on Board 111 they prefer not to 
			officiate for their team, home or away. This must be completed on
			<a href="http://www.arbitersports.com">ArbiterSports.com</a> by 
			October 1st of each year.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left">The assigner will request that all Board 111 members 
			in good standing (excluding Board 111 members that are also members 
			in good standing and working members of their college basketball 
			board) complete their calendar on
			<a href="http://www.arbitersports.com">ArbiterSports.com</a> for 
			availability by September 1st of each year. The above mentioned 
			college officials will have until on or about Oct 15th to block 
			dates based on their college dates being released at that time. 
			After said time, those officials will be under the same guidelines 
			as all other Board 111 members. Every official must keep their 
			calendar updated from Oct 15th to March 1st of the following year.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left">The schools will send their home schedule of games 
			to be assigned and the total service fee for the assigner by Sept 
			15th of each year.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left">Each active official will enter their personal 
			information on <a href="http://www.arbitersports.com">
			ArbiterSports.com</a> including name, address and telephone number 
			(cell also) along with email address. If official would like to 
			block a school or partner, this must be done through
			<a href="http://www.arbitersports.com">ArbiterSports.com</a> 
			calendar before Sept 1st of each year. If an official refuses an 
			assigned game and their calendar indicates that they are available, 
			a fine amounting to the assigner’s fee will be issued and payment is 
			expected to the assigner within 30 days or that official may be 
			brought before the Executive Committee and may be suspended for 1 
			year from April 1st of the following year.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left">After the Fall Business Meeting in November but 
			prior to the exam, the actual game assignments for the months of 
			November and pre-Christmas December games will be published on
			<a href="http://www.arbitersports.com">ArbiterSports.com</a> to 
			individual officials. It is expected that each official will check 
			his/her schedule and accept each game. Each school will be notified 
			of their officials 10 days before each assignment. Late December and 
			January games will be released in December and late January and 
			February dates will be released at or after the January rules 
			clinic.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left">All new officials will be on a mandatory two year 
			probationary period (including the year the official passed exam) 
			and will have only sub-varsity games assigned to them by the 
			assigner. After this probationary period an official may be assigned 
			varsity games based on information provided to the assigner, which 
			includes that official’s current rating.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left">Officials will be allowed to block certain 
			schools/teams home or away. Travel will not be allowed as an 
			acceptable reason for blocking a school or a team. Any official 
			refusing to work for a school must discuss the reason with the 
			assigner before the season.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left">An official will be assigned to no more than one 
			varsity game per day except in an emergency or hardship situation.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left">Schools can report to the assigner by email on 
			positive or negative feedback regarding an official’s performance.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left">Each official must be available to work a minimum of 
			20 total games per season (at any level) or that official may not 
			receive varsity games for that season.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left">The assigner should use discretion in using 
			officials at schools from which they graduated or towns in which 
			they live.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left">An official should not work at a high school that 
			has a relative employed by that school unless in a situation deemed
