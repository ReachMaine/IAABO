		Pre Game Meeting</b>…Suggestions, in addition to the 
routine introductions and three questions asked of the coaches; 1) Inform 
captains and head coaches that substitutes must wait until an official beckons 
them into the game. The incoming player should not enter the court when the horn 
is sounded. Adherence to this will enhance the substitution procedure and will 
help eliminate potential issues; 2) Check and/or remind the head coaches that 
their seat, if any, must be within the coaching box if they intend to make use 
of the coaching box. Doing so eliminates potential issues after the game has 
started.<font size="2" color="#643200" face="verdana"><img border="0" src="../pix/5.jpg" width="100" height="119" align="right"></font></p>

<p style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px" align="left"><b>Scorer &amp; Timer Instructions</b>…Referee, be professional 
and thorough with instructions to the scorer and timer. Be sure to designate 
each as the official scorer and timer and leave them with the 
impression/understanding that they are part of the officiating crew. Review the 
substitution procedure with them thoroughly. </p>

<p style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px" align="left"><b>Substitutes/Substitution Procedure</b>…Situations where 
the official administering a throw-in has checked/looked to the scorer and 
timer’s table, has had eye contact with partner(s) and is ready to cause the 
ball to become live – it is too late to accept substitutes. The game, by rule, 
can not be delayed to admit a substitute who is in route to the table or whose 
coach is hollering “sub, sub.” Ignore such situations and place the ball in 
play. Do not delay the game! There are two teams and the situation matters to 
both. The substitute did not meet the rule. The opposition may not want the 
substitute in the game. The official is not being a “good guy.” Instead, the 
official is positively affecting the illegal team and negatively affecting the 
opposition. Simply enforce the rule.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px" align="left"><b>Communicating With Head Coach And Player(s</b>)… When 
the ball is live, do not be distracted by coaches or players. Do not talk or 
respond in any other form/manner. All attention/concentration must be devoted to 
the play on the court when the ball is live.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px" align="left"><b>Closely Guarded</b>…Don’t be lax/slow in reacting to a 
closely guarded situation. The defense is expecting the rule to be enforced. Six 
feet is a substantial distance. Know what six feet is. If you don’t know what 
six feet is, how do you know when it is not six feet? Begin the five second 
count. There is no intense or specific defensive stance required of the 
defensive player.</p>










<p style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px" align="left"><b>Time-Out</b>…*Head Coaches and players only make a <b>
Request</b> for a time-out. Officials <b>Grant</b> the time-out. Upon 
seeing/recognizing the source of the request, the official now must <b>Check</b> 
to see if the request may be granted. * Don’t hurry and/or get excited. * The 
time-out Request and the Granting is simply another ruling situation in the 
game. * The “off ball” official, very often near the head coach, must be 
composed/careful/cautious about granting the time-out request. First and 
foremost Player Control must exist in order to grant the time-out. * The ball 
being pinned to the floor by one or two hands is not player control. * The 
time-out, as does every other situation, matters to and affects both teams. 
*Summary, to react to a request by sounding the whistle and carelessly granting 
a time-out, when there is no player control, bails out one team is very unfair 
to the other team.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px" align="left"><b>Traveling</b>…*Jump stop, be aware of the very 
athletically fluid one step then second step landing – it is illegal. It is a 
major advantage to the offensive player. That is exactly why she/he does so. * 
Be composed in the situation where the moving dribbler ends the dribble, obtains 
a pivot foot then steps with the non-pivot foot followed by lifting the pivot 
foot and reaches out with that foot and passes prior to the pivot foot 
re-touching the floor – legal movement. * Reminder, the pivot foot may be lifted 
to pass or try for goal.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px" align="left"><b>At The Site Of The Foul</b>…After sounding the whistle 
and stopping the clock/indicating a foul with the arm extended and a closed 
fist, remain at the site and complete all required at the site information (read 
the manual, pages 53 &amp; 141). Don’t run away. Don’t walk &amp; talk.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px" align="left"><b>At the Reporting Area</b>…Hustle to the reporting area. 
Stop. Complete all required at the reporting area information (read the manual, 
pages 52, 53,55 &amp; 141 &amp; 142). Hustle to the free throw or throw-in coverage 
position.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px" align="left"><b>Play Near A Boundary Line</b>…When there is 
congestion/defensive pressure (more than one player and the ball) near a 
boundary line, be careful not to be so concerned with the boundary line and the 
ball that you “tuck your chin/lower your chin” downward to the extent that you 
limit your FOV cone. Doing so, limits ones ability to view the whole play – the 
other player(s). Often a ruling of traveling or out-of-bounds is made. When in 
fact, an opposing player has bumped the player who has the ball causing what you 
view as a violation. Proper coverage matters, there is a possession at stake.
</p>

<p style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px" align="left"><b>Held Ball? Foul?...</b>A player has ended her/his 
dribble or is trapped. The offensive player’s ability is restricted by only 
being able to pivot. A defender(s) pursues the ball.<br>
<br>
While the offensive player is pivoting and/or moving 
her/his arms to get freedom or avoid a held ball, it is extremely difficult for 
a defender to get to the ball without contacting (hacking, bumping, etc.) the 
offensive player. It is very difficult to create a held ball without fouling in 
such a situation. Why are there so many held ball rulings? Think about it!!<font size="2" color="#643200" face="verdana"><img border="0" src="../pix/6.jpg" width="100" height="128" align="right"></font></p>


<p style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px" align="left"><b>Three-Seconds</b>…Be a good three-second official. The 
free throw lane’s proximity to the basket and the high percentage rate of 
scoring from that area makes the coverage and attention vital to fair play. The 
lead official ball watching, beyond her/his PCA and neglecting the free throw 
lane coverage is unfair to the defensive player and team. The Trail and Center 
official must provide free throw lane coverage when the ball is not in their 
PCA, by expanding their FOV cone.</p>



<p style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px" align="left"><b>Continuous Motion</b>…It is a rule given right of an 
offensive player, with the ball, to try for goal anytime, anyhow, and anyplace 
on the court, provided he/she does so legally. The player needs only to have 
‘merely’ begun foot, body, arm movement, etc. which&nbsp; habitually are associated 
with trying for a goal. The ‘shooter’ or a teammate being fouled does not cause 
the ball/play to become dead. The official’s sounding of the whistle and 
stopping the clock simply stops the clock and indicates a foul. The ball remains 
‘live.’<br>
<br>
A foul committed by a teammate of the ‘shooter’, prior to 
the try being released. Does cause the ball to become dead and therefore the try 
ends. THE ‘Shooter’s’ FOOT/FEET BEING IN TOUCH WITH THE FLOOR WHEN THE FOUL BY 
THE DEFENSE OCCURS HAS NO BARING ON THE RULE. Officials must be careful to not 
penalize a player who is simply carrying out her/his rule given right to try for 
goal. The player has that right whether sitting on the floor, standing on the 
floor or while airborne. If the try has simply ‘merely’ begun and there is a 
foul by the defense, the culprit is the defender – don’t penalize the wrong 
player. There is no place in basketball for the comment “on the floor” or the 
non-signal of pointing to the floor. It is gross misinformation and has caused 
much harm in recent years.&nbsp; </p>

<p style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px" align="left"><b>Contact</b>…Freedom of movement is rule assured provided 
the player arrives at any spot on the court first and does so legally. The 
understanding of the rule is vital and applies equally to defense and offense. 
Concerns are -- *Bumping, holding cutters – illegally preventing legal movement. 
* Offensive player driving to the basket area and bumping, warding off a 
defender – too often the offensive player is “bailed out” by the official ruling 
a foul on the defender. * Verticality - the offensive player when too far under 
the basket, even beyond the plane of the backboard, or otherwise near the basket 
jumps into the defender who is playing legal as per verticality. Too often the 
defender is unfairly penalized while the guilty party is awarded a goal and a 
free throw. Verticality, as per all rules, applies to both defense and offense. 
Questions are, in each of the situations, – Who caused the contact? What did the 
defender do wrong?&nbsp; </p>
<p style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px" align="left"><b>Contact Following The Release Of A Try For Goal</b>…Whether 
it is a two or three point try, after the ball is released, if the ‘shooter’ is 
in touch with the floor or has returned to the floor and the ‘ex-shooter’ is 
fouled – it is a common personal foul whether the try is successful or unsuccessful. The penalty is, the awarding of 
the ball for a throw-in, awarding a one and one or two free throws depending 
upon prior to or after the bonus is in effect.&nbsp; The penalty is not one, two, or 
three free throw as per ‘act of shooting.’</p>

<p style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px" align="left"><b>Crew Of Two</b>…When the throw-in is located on the Lead 
official side of the basketline and below the free throw line extended, be a 
thinking person’s official. Don’t automatically administer the throw-in as the 
Lead. Size up the situation, if there is defensive pressure the coverage may be 
improved by the Lead moving to the Trail position to administer the throw-in and 
the Trail becoming the Lead.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px" align="left"><b>Trail &amp; Center Official(s)…</b>Be active, especially 
when the ball is not within your PCA. Read the situation adjust your coverage 
positioning and your FOV cone. There are thoroughly arrived at guidelines within 
the manual, however, there are no magic spots cast in granite. In transition, 
don’t retreat prior to reading the situation at hand. Additionally in 
transition, especially when there is defensive backcourt pressure, the Center 
official’s PCA is free throw line to free throw line. The Center official’s FOV 
best covers across the court contact situations as all too often the Trail and 
Lead FOV is very much hindered (straight lined). </p>

<p style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px" align="left"><b>Multi Level Officials</b>…Reminder to officials who 
officiate at the high school and college levels – Honor each level. Bring the 
appropriate ‘package’ to the game site. Bring the appropriate rules code, 
mechanics, signals and overall mentality as expected by the involved level. 
Doing anything short of complying affects the coaches, players, partner(s) and 
very possibly the end result of the games. </p>

<p style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px" align="left"><b>PCAs</b>…Work at mastering the PCA technique. The 
concept/technique is the coverage master plan for a crew. Implement the FOV cone 
coverage. Be aware, widen, expand, lengthen your FVO cone depending upon whether 
the ball is within your PCA or not. It is vital to have a vivid mental 
impression of PCAs and FOV cones.</p>
