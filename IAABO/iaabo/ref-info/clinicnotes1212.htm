												<h3>Rules &amp; situations</h3>
												<ol>
													<li>A player leaving the 
													playing court for an 
													unauthorized reason to avoid 
													a screen, foul or violation 
													should be charged with a 
													violation, Rule 9.3.3. A 
													player leaving the court for 
													an unauthorized reason to 
													demonstrate resentment, 
													disgust or intimidation 
													should be charged with a 
													technical foul, Rule 
													10.3.6i.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
													<li>Delaying returning to 
													the court either purposely 
													or deceitfully after legally 
													being out of bounds is a 
													technical foul.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
													<li>Successive time-outs 
													after time has expired in 
													regulation or at the end of 
													an overtime period shall not 
													be granted, even though 
													there is still activity 
													remaining related to that 
													period.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
													<li>We are not time-out 
													monitors. We only notify the 
													head coach when they do not 
													have any time-outs 
													remaining.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
													<li>We need to do a better 
													job at monitoring long hair 
													during the pre-game warm-up. 
													Rule 3.7 addresses this 
													under safety concerns plus 
													we can apply Rule 2.3 
													regarding the hair 
													concealing the players 
													number. Ask the head coach 
													to address the player about 
													the hair situation. A good 
													rule of thumb is if the hair 
													is down over more than ½ of 
													the number on the back of 
													the jersey then it is too 
													long.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
													<li><b>A change in 
													interpretation regarding 
													hair control devices has 
													been given us. Any item that 
													is on the front part of the 
													head, either forehead or 
													further back on the front of 
													the head is considered a 
													headband and must conform to 
													the headband stipulations 
													regarding size, color and 
													logos. Hair control devices 
													worn at the back of the head 
													to keep the hair together or 
													up are not regulated to 
													color and only need to be 
													elastic, rubber or cloth.<br>
&nbsp;</b></li>
													<li>If a scoring mistake 
													from regulation play is 
													found while an overtime is 
													going on, the scoring 
													mistake is rectified but the 
													overtime is still played to 
													its’ completion once it is 
													started.</li>
													<li>Refer to Casebook play 
													6.4.1d regarding correcting 
													an AP arrow mistake when 
													there is a foul on an AP 
													throw-in.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
													<li>Remember, there is no 
													team control on a rebound, 
													therefore a player 
													rebounding the ball may 
													tip/tap the ball into the 
													backcourt where one of their 
													teammates may recover the 
													ball.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
													<li>Make sure to check when 
													arriving at the game site 
													who the game administrator 
													is that will be on duty 
													during the course of the 
													game.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
													<li>&nbsp;Utilize Rule 2.3 
													on any thing not covered 
													specifically in the rules.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
													<li>&nbsp;If the official 
													scorer is not in a striped 
													shirt, do not address it, 
													just send me an e-mail after 
													the game informing me of the 
													situation. If a coaching box 
													is not in place before the 
													game and the game 
													administrator does not want 
													to put one down at that 
													time, then the coaches 
													cannot use a coaching box 
													and must remain seated 
													during the game. Also, 
													inform me of this situation 
													after the game, the same as 
													if there are not other 
													proper marking on the court, 
													(i.e. “X” in front of 
													scorer, proper lane 
													markings) <br>
&nbsp;</li>
													<li>Be sure to count players 
													on the court after 
													time-outs, intermissions or 
													mass substitutions. This 
													will help avoid technical 
													fouls in these situations 
													for too many players on the 
													court.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
													<li>Fouls on throw-ins 
													should make us more alert to 
													possible team control foul 
													situations. The entire crew 
													should be aware in such 
													situations.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
													<li>In jump stop situations, 
													landing must be simultaneous 
													and the player does not have 
													to be airborne. They can be 
													jumping from one foot to a 
													two footed landing. A player 
													who is airborne and receives 
													the ball, can land on both 
													feet and have either foot as 
													a pivot foot, this is not a 
													jump stop, simply a two 
													footed landing.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
													<li>With 3/10 of a second or 
													less on the clock a player 
													can only score with a tap / 
													tip. If the player is fouled 
													after tipping an is still in 
													the air then they are 
													considered fouled in the act 
													of tipping and would receive 
													two or three shots if the 
													tap/tip is unsuccessful and 
													one shot if it is 
													successful. Casebook play 
													#5.2.5B needs to clarify if 
													the player is still in the 
													air or not.</li>
													<li>Continue to work on 
													outlet pass travels. Often 
													times the player is not 
													putting the ball to the 
													floor to start the dribble 
													before lifting the pivot 
													foot.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
													<li>Before the opening tap 
													is tossed the umpire should 
													check to make sure that the 
													head coaches chair is within 
													the coaching box. Even if 
													they say they are not going 
													to sit down, there should be 
													a chair for them within the 
													coaching box area.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
													<li>After a foul with a made 
													basket, we should be 
													awarding the basket first 
													both at the site of the foul 
													and to the table.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
													<li>If any type of foul, 
													technical or flagrant occurs 
													after time and activity have 
													expired for the game, it 
													still should be penalized. 
													If the shots would have a 
													bearing on the outcome of 
													the game then they are 
													administered, if not, the 
													foul is still recorded in 
													the book and the technical 
													or flagrant foul are 
													reported to the Interpreter. 
													If flagrant the player 
													involved would have to sit 
													out the next game. You have 
													jurisdiction until you leave 
													the visual confines of the 
													playing court.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
													<li>We need to continue to 
													work at ruling on contact 
													involving crashes and 
													collisions. Too many times 
													there is no whistle in these 
													situations when there needs 
													to be one.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
													<li>Free throw violations 
													are being called for players 
													entering the lane too soon 
													but we need to continue to 
													monitor this.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
													<li>Be sure to indicate the 
													spot of the ensuing throw-in 
													after violations and 
													non-shooting fouls. It is 
													important for crew coverage 
													and team information.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
													<li>Going ballside should 
													not occur until the ball has 
													settled into the frontcourt. 
													We should not be going 
													ballside when the ball is 
													still in backcourt.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
													<li>If you have delay 
													warnings or unusual 
													technical foul situations be 
													sure to inform the head 
													coach.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
													<li>Be sure to report all 
													technical fouls, even 
													administrative. The form is 
													on our Board #111 website.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
													<li>Mt. View middle school 
													plays in the Central Maine 
													League and they have some 
													special rules regarding 
													pressing. Please be aware if 
													you are assigned one of 
													their games that this is in 
													effect.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
													<li>If you are assigned to 
													pick someone up on a way to 
													a game please do not tell 
													them to meet you there since 
													they are not being paid for 
													travel.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
													<li>A few tips on rotating 
													when fouls are called in 
													three person officiating; 1. 
													Never pass one another for 
													the non-calling officials 2. 
													The non-calling official 
													closest to the basket will 
													administer the free throws.</li>

												<h3>Things We Say</h3>
												<p>The public &amp; media have a 
												perception of us as officials 
												and in many cases it is not 
												good. What we say and do can 
												affect this perception. They do 
												not realize what we have to do 
												as officials to become certified 
												and prepared. Anytime we can 
												help educate them through 
												boosters groups, service clubs 
												or team sessions would be to our 
												advantage.</p>
												<p>We need to be logical and 
												realistic in our decisions such 
												as dealing with medical related 
												items, we are not there to limit 
												people from participating.</p>
												<p>We should not be 
												participating in social chat 
												media as it relates to 
												officiating. This is an ethics 
												issue. In talking with the media 
												we should only be giving 
												interpretations and not talking 
												about judgment, players, teams 
												or schools.</p>
												<p>We cannot be continually 
												talking to coaches during the 
												course of the game and if we do 
												talk to them be brief, firm and 
												get moving. It takes our 
												concentration off the game if we 
												are talking to them. Sometimes 
												non-verbal communication is the 
												best such as eye contact, a nod, 
												or hand up as if saying that’s 
												enough. Never pour fuel on a 
												fire by antagonizing a coach or 
												hanging around them after a 
												technical foul or contested 
												ruling.</p>
												<p>As far as talking with 
												players, limit it unless dealing 
												with an issue. You can be 
												calming at times with things you 
												may say. They need to know we 
												are human too.</p>
												<p>Do not engage much with fans. 
												They do not know the rules and 
												are cheering with a bias. 
												Sometimes we can win them over 
												by being personable and human. 
												They need to know we are not 
												robots but are humans and do 
												have personalities, feelings and 
												can be humorous.</p>
												<p>When we are fans ourselves we 
												are held to a different standard 
												and should NEVER be giving 
												officials a hard time or making 
												derogatory comments towards 
												them. This is one of the worst 
												ethics violations and will be 
												dealt with.</p>
												<p>After the game be aware of 
												what we say and where. People 
												are listening. Don’t be a 
												complainer, especially to other 
												officials. They do not want to 
												hear it and it will affect how 
												they rate you. Come to a game, 
												do your job, leave and ZIP IT !!</p>
												<p>Thank you to David Anderson 
												for sharing an experience he had 
												last year in a game he was 
												involved. Hopefully it was a 
												learning experience for all of 
												us.</p>
