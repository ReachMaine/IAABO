		<img border="0" src="../pix/5.jpg" width="100" height="119" align="right">The rule applies anywhere in the 
		frontcourt when there is player control…legal guarding position, within 
		six feet, when guarding a player holding or dribbling the ball… no 
		particular stance required, doesn’t require aggressive/intense play by 
		the defender…multiple defenders may be involved provided each maintains 
		the six foot requirement when the “switch” occurs…the count ends and a 
		new count begins when the offensive player ends the dribble and holds 
		the ball or ends the holding and begins a dribble…the rule and count is 
		discontinued when the defender is “beaten” (offensive player gets head 
		and shoulders past the front plane of the defender) or when the distance 
		becomes greater than six feet…if you don’t know if it is six feet, how 
		do you know when it is not six feet?...care about recognizing the 
		situation and effort of the defense, apply the rule and the count…it 
		matters !</font><p align="left" style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px"><font size="2"><b>Guarding and 
		Block/Charge</b> – Defender obtains legal guarding position (initially, 
		both feet on the floor and facing the opponent)…then may maintain the 
		position which has been obtained until “beaten” ( the offensive player 
		gets head and shoulders past the defender’s front plane…time &amp; distance 
		are factors in obtaining legal guarding position when the offensive 
		player is moving without the ball…time &amp; distance are NOT factors when 
		the offensive player is stationery with or without the ball or moving 
		with the ball…if the offensive player is airborne prior to the defender 
		obtaining legal guarding position, the offensive player must allow the 
		opponent landing space…the defender has a rule given right to move the 
		feet, to jump and does not need to be still/set upon contact.. the 
		defender may turn, etc. to absorb the force of contact.</font><p align="left" style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px">
		<font size="2"><b>Free Throw Administration</b> – 
		<img border="0" src="../pix/6.jpg" width="100" height="128" align="left">Care about the 
		involved rules…there are two teams involved…carelessness on the 
		official’s part may favor one team…the plane of the free throw lane line 
		can’t be broken, with a foot, until the ball is at the basket or 
		backboard…potential disconcertion must be monitored…lane space players 
		can not leave the 3’ x 3’ lane space in any direction, prior to the ball 
		until the ball is at the basket or backboard…Trail or Center official 
		shall not close toward the endline prior to the ball reaching the basket 
		or backboard…proper coverage and enforcement of rules will nearly 
		eliminate the potential for rough play.</font><p align="left" style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px">
		<font size="2"><b>Three-Seconds</b> – Be a good three-second 
		official…care about monitoring free throw lane play…the lane’s proximity 
		to the basket and high percentage rate of scoring from that area makes 
		the coverage and attention vital to fair play…instances of 4 to 9 
		seconds are not uncommon…Lead official ball watching and neglecting the 
		free throw lane coverage when the ball is outside of his/her PCA is not 
		fair to the defending team…Trail and/or Center must aid in free throw 
		lane coverage, when the ball is not in their PCA, by expanding their FOV 
		cone.</font><p align="left" style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px"><font size="2"><b>Traveling </b>– Be 
		focused/concentrate, locate and maintain (“left, left”) coverage of the 
		pivot foot…watch the player receive the pass, secure the rebound, end 
		the dribble, begin the 3-point attempt, attempt a jump stop, attempting 
		a behind the back dribble, attempting a “spin” move, preparing to 
		dunk…illegal use of the pivot foot and/or ending a dribble and beginning 
		another dribble is a major advantage to the offense and a major 
		disadvantage to the defense.</font><p align="left" style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px"><font size="2"><b>
		Continuous Motion </b>– It is a rule given right of an offensive player, 
		with the ball, to try for a goal anytime anyhow and anyplace on the 
		court, provided he/she does so legally… the player need only to have 
		“merely” begun foot, body, arm movement which habitually are associated 
		with trying for a goal…the “shooter” or a teammate being fouled does not 
		cause the ball to become dead…the official’s whistle and stop the clock 
		signal simply stops the clock and indicates a foul, the ball remains 
		“live”…a foul committed by a teammate of the “shooter”, prior to the try 
		being released, does cause the ball to become dead and therefore ends 
		the try…the “shooter’s” foot/feet being in touch with the floor when the 
		foul by the defense occurs, does not end the try for goal, Continuous 
		Motion prevails. Officials must be careful to not penalize a player who 
		is simply carrying out her/his rule given right to try for goal…the 
		culprit in the situation is the defender, penalize the appropriate 
		player.</font></font><font face="verdana"><p><b>
		<font size="4" color="#FF0000">Flopping – Faking Being Fouled<br>
		Acting As If Charged Rule 10.3.6 (f)</font></b></font><font color="#643200" face="verdana"><p align="left">
		<font size="2">The defensive player or screener acting as though he/she 
		has been charged or pushed by an opponent, when in fact he/she has not 
		been charged or pushed very definitely has an adverse effect upon the 
		game. Without a doubt the practice is detrimental to the best interest 
		of the game. The “actor” wants to create the false impression that he/she 
		has been fouled when there has been no contact or it there was contact 
		it was incidental/legal (4.27). The “acting” guard or screener falls to 
		the floor as though he/she was placed there by the force of the 
		opponent. Through this action the player makes it appear that the 
		opponent ought to be penalized with a foul. It also incites the 
		spectators. Flopping (10.3.6 (f), as though being fouled, is an 
		unsporting act. Such conduct must be penalized with a technical foul. 
		Enforce the rule and eliminate the “act.”&nbsp;</font></font><font color="#FF0000" face="verdana"><p></font>
		<b><font color="#FF0000" face="verdana" size="4">
		&nbsp;Intentional Foul</font></b><font color="#643200" face="verdana"><p align="left">
		<font size="2">Far too often officials do not rule a foul as intentional 
		when the act clearly meets the criteria of an intentional foul. The 
		intentional foul ha<img border="0" src="../pix/3.png" width="100" height="121" align="right">s developed into an official’s personal 
		interpretation and misapplication of the rule. The defensive team is 
		given an unwarranted advantage when an intentional foul is not ruled 
		when committed. Intentional fouls may occur at anytime during the game. 
		The foul should be ruled intentional regardless of time and score.<br>
		<br>
		Some things to be aware of/look for are:</font><ol type="a">
			<li>
			<p align="left"><font size="2">Any contact which is not a legitimate 
			attempt to play the ball.</font></li>
			<li>
			<p align="left"><font size="2">Grabbing a player’s arm or body 
			without initially attempting to play or gain control of the ball.</font></li>
			<li>
			<p align="left"><font size="2">Any holding, pushing or grabbing a

			<li>
			<p align="left"><font size="2">Grabbing a player’s uniform.</font></li>
			<li>
			<p align="left"><font size="2">Wrapping arm(s) around a player.</font></li>
			<li>
			<p align="left"><font size="2">Pushing/grapping a player from behind 
			before or the act of shooting begins or during the act of shooting 
			(example, an apparent easy goal ).</font></li>
			<li>
			<p align="left"><font size="2">An obvious attempt to stop the clock 
			or neutralize the opponent’s obvious advantageous position by 
			forcing the opponent into a designated spot throw-in or free throw 
			situation.</font></li>
		</ol>
		</font><font face="verdana">
		<p><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">Toss</font></b></font><font color="#643200" face="verdana"><p align="left">
		<font size="2">By rule, the toss must be higher than either player can 
		jump…The ball is often contacted on its way up, it is a violation and 
		should be ruled as such…Observers note more poor tosses than accurate 
		tosses and no ruling being made requiring a re-toss…The tossing official 
		may rule that a re-toss is needed.</font></font><p>

		<font size="2" face="verdana"><b>Traveling – A Point of Emphasis (NFHS &amp; 
		IAABO)</b><br>
		It is good to observe this POE receiving attention. However, it is not a 
		traveling violation because we THINK it is. It is only a traveling 
		violation because we KNOW it is. It is not serving the rule and purpose 
		to “split hairs.” Again, the emphasis is attending to and KNOWING as 
		opposed to simply THINKING or guessing regarding the use of the pivot 
		foot. The pivot foot must be identified, then monitored for legal or 
		illegal use of the pivot foot. Reminder, the use of the pivot foot is 
		considerably different when a player is moving while passing or trying 
		for goal than it is when beginning a dribble. There can be very 
		unorthodox movement prior to a pass or try for goal and the movement be 
		legal.</font><p align="left" style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px">
		<font size="2" face="verdana"><b>Hand checking, bumping, pushing, holding</b> 
		and in general aggressive defensive and offensive contact not being 
		ruled fouls. Such contact affects ball handlers, cutters, screeners, 
		rebounders, post players, individual and team styles of play – both 
		defensive and offensive players are affected and must be closely 
		monitored. The official does not have the choice of whether the contact 
		matters to him/her. What matters is, it does matter to the players and 
		teams because it affects what they want and need to accomplish.</font><p align="left" style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px">
		<font size="2" face="verdana"><b>Loose ball</b> – monitor the contact 
		closely. Bumps, etc. can affect the end result – it matters. </font>
		<p align="left" style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px">
		<font size="2" face="verdana"><b>Potential held ball/jump ball situations</b> 
		– both players must be controlling the ball or a hand must be so firmly 
		on the ball that control cannot be obtained without undue roughness in 
		order to rule a held ball.</font><p align="left" style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px">
		<font size="2" face="verdana"><b>Player out of bounds (thrower; due to 
		momentum; falls out of bounds; etc).</b>The player returns to inbounds 
		status when he/she is not in touch with out-of-bounds. One foot 
		in-bounds is sufficient. Other than the thrower of the throw-in, a 
		player returning from out-of-bounds may be the first to touch/catch the 
		ball in-bounds. In and of itself, returning to in-bounds status and 
		being the first to touch or gather in the ball is not a violation.</font><p align="left" style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px">
		<font size="2" face="verdana"><b>Substitutions </b>– Do not hold up the 
		game to admit substitutes. Seeing a team member move toward the table is 
		to be ignored. Substitutes must report and the horn must sound prior to 
		the official being ready to administer the throw-in or free throw. 
		Officials are too lax with this item.</font><p align="left" style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px">
		<font size="2" face="verdana"><b>As center official,</b> don’t retreat 
		(transition) too soon, remain and read the coverage needs.</font><p align="left" style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px">
		<font size="2" face="verdana"><b>When reporting fouls, time-outs, warnings 
		-</b> hustle to and from the reporting area; don’t walk &amp; talk. 
		Reminder, do not overlook the “freezing field of vision” foul coverage 
		mechanic.</font><p align="left" style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px">
		<font size="2" face="verdana"><b>Primarily, the Team Control Signal</b> 
		means there will be no free throws as the foul was committed by a 
		player, of the offensive team, who was not in control of the ball – 
		don’t get excited and make it a “punch”. It is not a specific type of 
		foul. The type of foul is hold, push, etc.</font><p align="left" style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px">
		<font size="2" face="verdana"><b>Palming &amp; Carrying </b>– needs attention 
		and enforcement. Observations find there are at least as many palming or 
		carrying violations going unattended to as there are traveling 
		violations unattended to. Often the ball handler plays with the ball 
		like it is attached to a yo-yo. “Cupping” (hand under the ball holding 
		it/catching it and throwing a short bounce pass toward her/his other 
		hand, not dribbling the ball, then “cupping” and throwing it back to the 
		other hand. After two or three “palming”/ending of the dribble, the 
		player then easily beats the defender. </font>
		<p align="left" style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px">
		<font size="2" face="verdana"><b>Officials make mistakes.</b> Realize it 
		and understand it. Our mistakes affect players and teams and they matter 
		to coaches. It is not only players and coaches who make mistakes. Have a 
		passion and professional pride – prepare thoroughly to limit your 
		mistakes. </font>
		<p align="left" style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px">
		<font size="2" face="verdana">
		<img border="0" src="../pix/4.jpg" width="69" height="125" align="right"><b>Communication with coaches </b>– don’t 
		hold up the game (allowance for rare exception); primarily be a 
		listener; one can’t improve upon silence; be composed, be courteous; be 
		professional; never personalize a response; don’t argue; consider 
		bringing both coaches together when you do take time to listen or 
		respond to a coach; never react with “shut up”, “your wrong”, etc. Don’t 
		display, verbally or physically, an “attitude.” What happens in the gym, 
		stays in the gym. If a player or coach is penalized for misbehavior, 
		don’t double tax them by gossiping with fellow officials about the

		<p align="left" style="text-indent: -25px; margin-left: 25px">
		<font face="verdana"><font size="2"><b>Officials receiving both high

		mechanics and signals are acceptable. Be professional and care, honor 
		the level which you are serving. Observations noted – closing on the 
		release of the free throw; not getting to the reporting area; not 
		signaling the clock to stop violation rulings; no at the site of the 
		foul signals &amp; information (hit &amp; run officiating); too much 
		conversation with coaches when the ball is in play; no stop the

		<b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">Food For Thought and Review Items</font></b></font><font color="#643200" face="verdana"><p align="left">
		<font size="2">The game is to be played according to the rules, NOT 
		according to officials and coaches individual philosophies.<br>
		<br>
		When the official finds the rules and accepts them, he/she will find 
		his/her purpose within the game.<br>
		<br>
		Can officials make accurate rulings on rules they don’t know?... Do the 
		coaches, players, fans and media have the right to assume that officials 
		know the rules?<br>
		<br>
		Officiating is not an Art.., Don’t try to make it an Art… Rather, 
		officiating is a Science.<br>
		<br>
		The vast majority of rulings made during a game do not require a whistle 
		and penalty as the action is legal. Some rulings, on the average-60 per 
		game, are accompanied by a whistle and are penalized because the action 
		is illegal…The point is, we are making rulings throughout the game – 
		thousands of our rulings do not require a whistle and penalty.<br>
		<br>
		Rebounding play – See the entire play, the beginning, development and 
		the end…Be certain that what appears to be “on the back” is not being 
		“put on the back/backing out” by the inside rebounder.<br>
		<br>
		<img border="0" src="../pix/6.jpg" width="100" height="128" align="left">It is not the role of an official to control or manage the game…The 
		official’s role is to monitor the play, apply the rule and arrive at a 
		ruling of legal or illegal.<br>
		<br>
		Don’t let praise or criticism get to you…It is a weakness to get caught 
		up in either one.<br>
		<br>
		Don’t personalize criticism…Be a listener… Learn to listen.<br>
		<br>
		You can’t officiate when upset or angry with self or others…It is 
		difficult to make accurate decisions when angry.<br>
		<br>
		No one is in charge of your officiating happiness but you.<br>
		<br>
		Treat players, coaches and fellow officials the way you would like to be 
		treated…Respect the game and the participants at all times.<br>
		<br>
		Realize that the game and the opportunity to play if means much to the 
		participants for many and various reasons.<br>
		<br>
		Don’t be caught by surprise…Be alert/Be ready/Be prepared at all times, 
		including during dead ball time.<br>
		<br>
		Casual application of rules can favor a style of play or harm a style of 
		play.<br>
		<br>
		What is allowed/condoned is encouraged to continue…Tolerance favors 
		compliance or non-compliance?...We reap what we sow—what we don’t 
		enforce, we encourage!<br>
		<br>
		Enforce the rules, players and coaches will adjust.<br>
		<br>
		Enforce the rules with no regard to time and score.<br>
		<br>
		Be thorough with instruction to scorer and timer.<br>
		<br>
		Be thorough with informing the table personnel and Head Coaches when 
		informing them of extra period procedures (jump ball, direction of play, 
		four minutes, time-outs, etc.).<br>
		<br>
		Help situations…May be asked for…May be offered…Be clear when sharing 
		information don’t cause confusion.<br>
		<br>
		During pre-game on the court, use the time wisely…It is a vital part of 
		preparation time (officials; warm-up time)… Observe the use of pivot 
		foot (3-point attempts, “spin” moves, post players practicing, etc).<br>
		<br>
		Make eye contact with partner every time a whistle is sounded or heard.<br>
		<br>
		Be thorough with all at the site of foul information…Be thorough with 
		all at the site of violation information.<br>

		At times, it is heard about signals “It doesn’t matter.”… If “it doesn’t 
		matter”, do what is expected - do it right?...A majority of the signals 
		are required By Rule.<br>
		<br>
		Signals are the language of the game…Signals are vital to communications 
		with all involved…Additionally, taking the time to signal/communicate, 
		as the game expects, can serve as a calming/pacing /settling affect upon 
		a hectic, noisy and emotional setting.<br>
		<br>
		The greatest virtues in officiating are composure and wisdom.<br>
		<br>
		Always demonstrate professionalism, composure, confidence, 
		understanding, dignity, and integrity.<br>
		<br>
		Always have a thorough pre-game conference...Use of IAABO pre-game card 
		is encouraged.<br>
		<br>
		Post game…Take time to review, comment, share feedback…Individual &amp; Crew 
		appraisal, questions, recommendations… We are all in this together…Be 
		the best that we can be.<br>
		<br>
		Consider requesting a DVD of the game, do so a couple of times per 
		season…Deal with the Athletic Administrator, not the coach…Offer to pay 
		for it.<br>

		Have you received a copy of IAABO’s Early Season Memo? If not, consider
