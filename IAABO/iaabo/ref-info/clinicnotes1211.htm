		45 people got them all right on the Manual Exam, with another 20 missing 
		only one . 24 members received 100% on both exams. The most missed 
		questions on the Rules Exam were #’s; 13, 7, 2, 20, 27, 31, 37, &amp; 21. 
		The most missed question on the Manual Exam, for the third year in a row 
		was # 6, followed by #’s; 29, 19, 27, 18, 5 &amp; 7. Of 117 members taking 
		the exam only 7 did not receive a score of 86% or better.<br>

		Be sure to report all technical fouls on the form found on our Board’s

		you find a gymnasium that does not have the proper floor markings, 
		please do not address it with the coaches or game administrator. Contact 
		me after the game and I will address the issue with the school contact 
		person. This way you are not put in an awkward situation or create any 
		animosity.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#643200" face="verdana">
		Unless you deem it very unsafe, please allow participants to play with 
		any specialized protective or medical equipment that is designed for 
		their situation. Hopefully they have a medical note supporting their use 
		of such equipment, but we want to be inclusive. Such things as insulin 
		pumps etc. should be worn under the jersey. This does not circumvent the 
		rule of no casts or unyielding material on the arm.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#643200" face="verdana">You 
		may be the Referee for the first time in your officiating career this 
		year, have you practiced your toss ? Veterans, you need to practice the 
		toss just like players practice their shooting. It is something we do 
		not do well and need to improve on.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#643200" face="verdana">
		Referee be sure to check with the Game Administrator when you arrive at 
		the game site to see if there is a health care professional on duty that 
		night. You need to know this information so that you can determine who 
		will make the decision whether to allow a player demonstrating 
		concussive symptoms to return to the game once removed.</font></p>
		<h4 align="left"><font color="#643200" face="verdana">Things that have 
		been brought to my attention or observed during the pre-season.</font></h4>
		<ul type="square">
			<li>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
			<font color="#643200" face="verdana">- Remember, warnings must be 
			given to each team before a technical foul is called. A warning for 
			one team does not apply to both teams. Also, the table and offending 
			coach must be notified of the warning.</font></p></li>
			<li>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
			<font color="#643200" face="verdana">- The Referee shall notify the 
			scorer, timer and captains of the overtime procedure by telling them 
			that there will be a 4 minute overtime started with a jump ball, a 
			new AP arrow setting, each team receives an additional 60 second 
			time-out and the team baskets remain the same. The Coach does not 
			have to be in this meeting but they should be told if they ask the 
			procedure.</font></p></li>
			<li>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
			<font color="#643200" face="verdana">- Never bounce the ball across 
			the lane for an endline throw-in.</font></p></li>
			<li>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
			<font color="#643200" face="verdana">- Make sure to switch on all 
			fouls, whether shots are involved or not. </font></p></li>
			<li>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
			<font color="#643200" face="verdana">- Lane violations involving 
			players along the lane, only the first violation is penalized, 
			whereas a violation along the lane by the defense followed by one by 
			the shooter or an offensive team member outside the arc/free throw 
			line extended constitutes a double violation. If it is part of 
			multiple free throws, the penalty is cancellation of the involved 
			free throw. If it is the last free throw then the penalty goes to 
			the AP arrow to determine possession.</font></p></li>
			<li>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
			<font color="#643200" face="verdana">- A kicked throw-in by an 
			opponent after a made basket does not negate the privilege of being 
			able to run the endline. If there is a kicked AP throw-in by the 
			defense, the throw-in team receives the ball back for the kick and 
			still retains the AP arrow for the next AP throw-in.</font></p></li>
			<li>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
			<font color="#643200" face="verdana">- If a team is still in the 
			locker room at halftime and consumes one full minute after the 
			intermission has ended, then the resumption of play procedure is 
			used to start the second half.</font></p></li>
			<li>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
			<font color="#643200" face="verdana">- During a resumption of play 
			throw-in, if the wrong team steps across the boundary line and picks 
			up a ball that has been placed down at a team’s disposal, this would 
			constitute a warning for breaking the boundary plane. It would not 
			be a technical and considered the same as slapping the ball out of a 
			player’s hand out of bounds. </font></p></li>
			<li>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
			<font color="#643200" face="verdana">- If players come to shake our 
			hands prior to the game we are not to refuse to do so. It must be a 
			handshake too, we are not to “bump” fists or elbows.</font></p></li>
			<li>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
			<font color="#643200" face="verdana">- Remember, correctable error 
			situations can be corrected if caught within the proper timeframe. 
			We can cancel, award or re-shoot attempts under the proper 
			conditions.</font></p></li>
			<li>
			<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
			<font color="#643200" face="verdana">- If a technical foul is called, 
			even if it involves contact on a player, any eligible player can 
			shoot the penalty throws for that foul, it does not have to be the 
			player that was fouled.</font></p></li>

			<img border="0" src="../pix/6.jpg" width="100" height="128" align="left"></font><font color="#643200" face="verdana"><b>Review 
		pages 127 &amp; 139 of the Manual</b> to be sure we are using the proper 
		procedures at the site of the foul, presentation to the table and site 
		of the violation. We need to do a much better job with these duties so 
		that we are all consistent in our presentation, and so that players and 
		coaches see consistent presentation from game to game. For those of you 
		officiating both college and high school games make sure you use high 
		school signals and mechanics when refereeing a high school game. If you 
		cannot honor the high school game with proper signals and mechanics then 
		tell the Assigner that you should not work that level game.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#643200" face="verdana">
		Let’s do a better job with our<b> visual freeze after a foul is called.
		</b>Remember, the non-calling officials responsibility is to observe all 
		players while the foul is being reported. Let’s not become oblivious to 
		what the players are doing during this period of time. Don’t worry about 
		the ball.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#643200" face="verdana"><b>
		Remember, Board #111 now has a Solicitation Policy in place</b>. Members 
		are not to solicit games in any manner from schools, coaches or AA’s. If 
		an AA asks you to officiate a pre-season game or get officials for such 
		a game then that is OK but you should first contact the Assigner to see 
		if you may have those teams involved within the next few weeks of 
		assignments.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#643200" face="verdana">
		Good luck in your upcoming games, have a great holiday season. <b>Our 
		next and final clinic will be Sunday January 8 at 10 am in Room 137
