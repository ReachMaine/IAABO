        <blockquote>
			<p>Game observations by the Commissioner make it clear that the 
			overall quality of officials and officiating is in very good order 
			in Maine) That being said, we need to be aware and concerned about 
			the following areas;</p>
			<ol>
				<li>When we accept an assignment we are a teacher for that 
				night. We are serving the schools. They expect professionalism, 
				thorough preparation, applying &amp; enforcing the rules with no 
				regards to the score, time, individual or team situation. Teams 
				have prepared long &amp; hard and expect officials to meet the 
				expectations.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Contact (illegal vs. incidental) Too many hands on, arm bars 
				leaning on, reaching behind. Demand verticality on rebounding. 
				Why do players create contact, to help their opponent ? All 
				contact should be suspicious at first. Skirmishes for ball, 
				especially near sideline causing player with ball to move pivot 
				foot or go out of bounds and rule against the player with the 
				ball is not acceptable.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Traveling - When receiving pass and not dribbling properly 
				immediately. Allows dribbler to beat defender if they are 
				allowed to take a step before putting ball to the floor.<ol>
					<li>Jump stop – Players are being allowed to step after jump 
					stop. Don’t confuse with 2 footed landing.</li>
					<li>Spin move and Euro Step are only legal if performed 
					within the restrictions of the pivot requirements.</li>
					<li>Post player jumping backwards before dropping the ball 
					or stepping backwards with the pivot foot<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Behind the back dribble or delay dribbling out front. Too 
				often the dribble ends and then is started again since ball 
				comes to rest. </li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Mechanics</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Ball location does not dictate coverage position. Players 
				may be elsewhere.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>PCA coverage is vital, know your area and master it, if 
				nothing going there then cover next closest matchup. Continual 
				self talk,” my ball, their ball”<br>
				<b>Don’t call in front of your partner unless it absolutely 
				needs a ruling.</b><br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Officiate every live ball situation. Many times on throw-ins 
				and free throws(1st of multiple) we relax and are not prepared.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Stay wide as the Lead when the ball is on your side of 
				basketline. Should not be turning head to look towards sideline.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Be sure to verbalize color along with indicating direction 
				on rulings.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Hustle to reporting area, (remember, reporting area is used 
				for more than just fouls.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Slow down with stop the clock signals. Make it two separate, 
				distinct signals. Too fast, all blurred into one.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>10 second count on free throws is visible and not totally 
				inconspicuous.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Do not give resuming play procedure until both teams are 
				ready unless one team is not on floor after 2nd horn.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>On throw-ins start next to player, designate the spot then 
				step back. Don’t go into backcourt or way away from thrower if 
				everyone is packed into frontcourt. Don’t bounce right next to 
				player and don’t flip the ball.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Must have a horn for subs unless table has fallen asleep. Do 
				not hold up game for sub running from bench.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Start closely guarded counts immediately, no specific stance 
				required as long as within 6’. Trail often has a closely guarded 
				situation in frontcourt. Switch hands.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Positioning as Trail on free throws should be about one step 
				behind the foul line extended and half to two thirds way to 
				sideline. Closing down too soon is a problem, puts one in an 
				improper position to see players responsible for.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Kicking must be intentional act, usually there are very few 
				kicks in a game.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Enforce the coaching box rule.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Nearest spot is important. Indicate, then designate. Too 
				many not indicating, partner is confused. Don’t make such 
				signals a secret, all 10 players need to know.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Team control foul signal is not a punch and it is not used 
				for player control. Only depicts “no shots”<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Beckon subs with one arm, not fingers. (signal on page 199) 
				Pointing direction is open palm with tucked thumb. (page 199)</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Specific situations</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Postioning of calling official for time-out. Decide in 
				pre-game how to handle it. Options are go back to original 
				position immediately or stay at division line during time-out 
				and then go back to original position after time-out.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Coach/ asst. coach can check book at table at halftime, only 
				managers &amp; statisticians can during game, not assistant coaches.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>If mouth guards are used they must be worn properly, cannot 
				be hanging out of mouth. Treat like shirts not worn properly and 
				remove player.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Uniform in Maine is beltless slacks.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>End of game scenarios. Be clock aware but must have definite 
				knowledge. Cover situation with crew before making the final 
				decision.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>More than 5 players on floor is a team technical, not on 
				coach. See chart on page 70 in rulebook. Player T’s are never 
				charged to coach, only bench technicals.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Be sure to switch on all foul rulings. Reasoning is so you 
				are not in same position next time down the floor to possibly 
				make the same ruling. Partner, force switch.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Granting time-outs, must be player control during a live 
				ball. Request is only the start to the process. Official must 
				process the request and see if it can be granted. Be composed. 
				Player sliding on floor due to momentum but having control of 
				the ball may request a time-out and it can be granted.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Free throw lane rulings. Remember, only first along lane is 
				penalized. Shooter or those outside 3 point arc can create a 
				double violation. If first violation is by free throwers team 
				then throw is over. When there is a violation along the lane by 
				opponents and the shooter misses the rim, it should at least run 
				through our mind, was that disconcertion ?<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Referee can designate partner to toss but not other duties.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>If net wraps up we do not stop play during live ball to put 
				it down.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>A foul by the offense after a shot is taken is not a team 
				control foul, shots will be taken if team is in the bonus.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>If there is a technical foul at halftime, the 2nd half 
				starts with shots and throw-in by shooting team, arrow remains 
				with which team had it for next AP situation.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Slapping ball from opponent in your frontcourt after having 
				control and losing it to the other team is not a backcourt 
				violation if you go into backcourt to retrieve it.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Pre-game handshake is to be a handshake, not a fist bump, 
				even if requested by coach.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Honor both games rules/signals if you are a college 
				official. Remember, you are being watched by other officials.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Wristbands/headbands. Team has white shirts with blue and 
				yellow trim. Blue &amp; yellow are their two school colors. Legal 
				colors would then be, white, beige, black, blue or yellow. All 
				must be the same color.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Do not put on your T-report forms that you warned someone.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Dead ball tweaks that make you look powerful, confident, 
				professional;<br>
				a.) Holding ball high during deadballs such as jumps, time-outs, 
				subs., delays. Standing tall, not slouching, no hands on hips or 
				knees.<br>
				b.) Spit the whistle out after stopping the clock (partner hold 
				briefly in case if needed)<br>
				c.) Don’t walk &amp; talk, if legs are moving your lips should be 
				still, when your feet stop your lips can start.<br>
				20. NCAA research says college officials get rulings correct 90% 
				of time but only 62 – 63 % on block/charge. I think we do a 
				better job at the high school level but still need to work on 
				it.<br>
