				<p align="left"><b>TO: IAABO BOARD #111 OFFICIALS <br>
				FR: Peter Webb, INTERPRETER</b><br>
				<br>
				The regular season is rapidly coming to a close. At this time of 
				year many games as seen as more meaningful by those involved. Be 
				prepared to meet the challenge.<br>
				<br>
				Maintain a positive attitude. It has been a busy season for most 
				of you. It is easy to get discouraged at times. Don’t let that 
				happen. Every game is a fresh start. The school, coaches, 
				players and spectators are expecting outstanding service from 
				you.<br>
				<br>
				<b>TAKE YOUR TIME! </b>Each and every ruling stop the clock 
				(hold it) then signal properly – DON’T HURRY! This has a very 
				calming effect on the entire gym as well as the crew. If you 
				tend to be too quick try this. It becomes comforting to you; it 
				improves communication for all and can be a confidence builder 
				for you and all who are watching you. This type of officiating 
				enhances the Crew’s professionalism status.<br>
				<br>
				Only the Head Coach may be off the bench/seat.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Traveling — </b>BE SURE that you have identified the pivot 
				foot; remember it by “left, left, left” self talk. Don’t be 
				guilty of ruling a legal move as a travel. There are some 
				awkward looking moves as a player ends a drive or dribble and 
				continues to move feet while attempting to pass. Usually the 
				movement is legal. Often I observe it being ruled illegal. A 
				pivot foot is placed on the floor. Next the stopping foot is 
				placed on the floor.<br>
				Next the pivot foot is lifted off of the floor and the leg/foot 
				is then reaching out, in a follow through move and the player 
				passes or attempts a try for goal. This is a legal as the pivot 
				foot is not returned to the floor prior to the ball being 
				released. Think hard —<br>
				TO RULE THIS A TRAVEL TAKES THE BALL AWAY FROM THE TEAM WHO 
				LEGALLY HAS IT AND AWARDS THE TEAM WHO SHOULD STILL BE ON 
				DEFENSE. If you were the player or coach would you be upset? 
				This happens.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Traveling/Pivot Foot as regards the post player. —</b> 
				Basically the same as above. A post player maintains a pivot 
				foot (identify it) while moving the non-pivot foot first to the 
				left (in a cross over step) then moves the non-pivot foot back 
				to the right, places it on the floor then pushes off with it 
				while reaching out with the pivot foot and releases the ball on 
				a try or pass prior to replacing the old pivot on the floor. 
				Legal. It may cover a lot of space but is not a violation. In 
				this case an official not caring enough to identify the pivot 
				foot may take away a legal two points from Team A, deprive them 
				of both the points and the ball then give the ball to Team B. 
				What an effect on the game and feelings players, coaches and 
				fans.<br>
				<br>
				<b>The Whistle — </b>There are officials who think other 
				officials “blow the whistle too much”. Those who think that way 
				should examine their own work and ask do I “blow the whistle 
				enough?”<br>
				Usually the “calls” that we make with a whistle don’t hurt the 
				game and most people can live with it. However, the “calls” that 
				we make and don’t blow the whistle do hurt/effect the game. It 
				has been known for years that coaches, given a choice, would 
				prefer more whistles as opposed to not enough whistles. In 
				general, the official who tends to “let them play” is putting 
				him/her self into the game. That creates unfairness and that is 
				as bad as it gets. If that is your thought process, it is BAD – 
				change.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Contact — </b>The rules are not anti an aggressive defense or 
				anti screening offenses. However, the rules do not permit 
				illegal contact. Bumping the dribbler in the backcourt, bumping 
				the cutters going through and around the lane area are FOULS. 
				Placing a hand(s)/arms on a dribbler in the backcourt, the 
				frontcourt or on a drive to the basket is a FOUL. Offensive 
				players using forearms and displacing the defender or pushing 
				off while screening is a FOUL.<br>
				<br>
				Contact, especially at the end of the game, should be monitored 
				and ruled the same as it is ruled all game long. There is LEGAL 
				CONTACT there is ILLEGAL CONTACT.<br>
				<br>
				Example, Team A has scored. B-1’s throw in goes to B-2. B-2 gets 
				by defender A-2. <br>
				Now A-2 is behind B-2. While both are progressing toward the 
				division line, A-2 behind B-2, A-2 reaches out and contacts B-2. 
				Is that contact? YES. Is that illegal contact? NO. Should a foul 
				be ruled? NO. The contact is INCIDENTAL (4.27). The contact did 
				not affect the play of B-2. That player should still be 
				dribbling and helping the team in an offensive effort. Why is 
				such a situation ruled a foul?<br>
				<br>
				<b>Ball watching —</b> Check yourself. If you are a ball watcher 
				you are hurting the crew and not serving the game very well.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Officials talking too much. — </b>The majority of the 
				concerns/complaints that are received by the Interpreter and the 
				Commissioner involve “talking officials”. Complaints regarding 
				officials’ rulings seldom get beyond the non-liking stage of the 
				coach or fan. Officials can eliminate the “talking” problem by 
				not talking. One can not improve on silence. Silence can not be 
				quoted. Let your whistle of no whistle do the talking. When the 
				official talks – misstatements take place; misunderstanding 
				takes place; embarrassment takes place; feelings are hurt; 
				defensive attitudes take place; response take place; etc. The 
				result often is that officials hurt themselves and the overall 
				appraisals of all officials suffer.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Gossip – </b>Officials talking about schools, coaches, 
				players, fans, fellow officials in a careless manner serves no 
				good purpose. If you were “down” would you want someone 
				gossiping about you? A technical foul, an ejection, misbehaving 
				fans are just that. They either have been penalized and/or dealt 
				with otherwise. It is just a part of the event. When the game is 
				over, those things are in the past. Report them to the proper 
				source and cast the issue aside. No one wants to hear of their 
				misbehavior being broadcast.<br>
				<b><br>
				Keep up the overall very good officiating and overall service 
				that you provide.</b> Do some self evaluation and together make 
				these last two weeks the very best that we can. Be an 
				outstanding partner. Be prepared, have a thorough pre-game 
				conference. Be alert from the time you arrive on the court. 
				Don’t be caught by surprise. Attend to business. Shine 
				professionally.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Accentuate the Positive –</b> Eliminate the Negative. Work 
				hard, take things seriously and realize as much fun as possible.</p>
		<p>The Interpreter and the Commissioner are supporters of you and your 
		work.</p>
