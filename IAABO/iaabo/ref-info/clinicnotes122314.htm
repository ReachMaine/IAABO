			<h3>Rules and Manual Tests were handed out. </h3>
			<p>The average score on the Rules Exam was 2.056 questions wrong and 
			1.981 wrong on the Manual. 33 members got them all right on the 
			Rules Exam, 27 members missed one and 16 missed two. 36 members got 
			all the Manual questions correct, with 28 missing only one and 12 
			missing two. 23 members got them all right on both exams.</p>
			<p>The most missed questions on the Rules Exam were; #9(23), #2(18), 
			#28(15), #35(12) and #’s 10 &amp; 42(11). For the Manual Exam #8(23) was 
			the most missed, followed by; #2(20), #9(13), #21(12), #12(11), and 
			#’s 5,6,7 &amp;27(10).</p>
			<p>Problem questions on the Refresher Exam were reviewed. Those 
			included questions #11, 12, 17, 24, 27, 33, 37, 38, 44, 49, 52, 57, 
			63, 64, 65, 67, 69, 73, 74 &amp; 75. If you have any questions on any of 
			these please feel free to contact the Interpreter.</p>
			<h3>Situations that have occurred or observed during pre-season &amp; 
			the first week of the season.</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>If there is a shot with the shooter being fouled or the 
				shooter committing a foul, and then the ball lodges between the 
				backboard &amp; ring before becoming dead, the penalty for the foul 
				is administered and the ball put back in play either with free 
				throws or a throw-in depending on who commits the foul. The AP 
				arrow is used on lodged balls only if there is no other activity 
				associated with the situation and there is no way to determine 
				possession, since there is no team control.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>During a non-designated throw-in, which is preceded by a 
				time-out, the throw-in team may request that you give them the 
				ball on the other side of the lane. This should be allowed. They 
				can still move the end line, but they would be allowed to be 
				handed the ball on that side of the lane.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>A shot going thru the basket and falling directly into the 
				shooter’s hands, who then just sets the ball on the floor, is 
				not considered interfering with the ball.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Concussion caps are legal and may be worn. There is one team 
				in Eastern Maine that has two players wearing them. Usually 
				there will be a note from the Commissioner in the front of the 
				team’s scorebook saying they are approved.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Remember, a kick must be an intentional act and it is the 
				entire leg.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Player control and team control are different fouls. They 
				have the same penalty but different signals. The team control 
				foul signal is preceded by the type of foul signal followed by 
				the team control foul signal, which only indicates “no shots 
				will be taken”<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Under the free throw lane rule, if the defense backs up over 
				the free throw line before the ball hits the rim, it is a 
				delayed violation. If that defender backed up over the line and 
				bumped the free thrower, the delayed violation would take 
				precedent over the contact unless that contact was flagrant or 
				intentional.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Casts may not be worn at any time by a player, even if 
				covered with foam or padding. It must not be allowed !<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Officials MUST monitor players hair during pre-game and 
				address the Head Coach if the hair is too long. If long hair or 
				braids/ponytail are covering more than half the number then it 
				is too long. Be sure to follow-up and not allow the player to 
				participate if they do not correct the situation. You are doing 
				an injustice to officials that follow you if you do not deal 
				with it! T-shirts also need to be monitored during pre-game and 
				dealt with appropriately. Remember, they must be the same color 
				as the predominant color of the uniform shirt.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>We need to do a better job of indicating the throw-in spot 
				on the end line, especially when it is going to be put in play 
				on the other side of the lane.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Be aware of players trying to block their opponent from 
				being able to save a ball from going out of bounds by blocking 
				or holding them from getting to the ball.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Players and bench personnel may stand during 30 &amp; 60 second 
				time-outs. Players can only sit during 60 second time-outs, they 
				must remain standing for a 30 second time-out. Bench personnel 
				may not be standing during a 20 second interval of time to 
				replace an injured or disqualified player.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>It is very obvious that too many officials are ball 
				watching. Eye, head and body positioning give you away ! Master 
				your PCA and trust you partner(s).<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>As the Lead, stay wide when the ball is on your side of 
				basket line. Your home base should be near where the 3 point arc 
				intersects the end line. Never have to look behind you to pick 
				up play. You can close down when the ball crosses the basket 
				line.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>We are enforcing hand checking pretty well now but what 
				players are now doing is bumping the dribbler with their body 
				all the way up the court without contacting them with their 
				hands. This is a foul too and must be ruled such.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>During pre-game, talk about communicating as a Crew when you 
				reach 6 &amp; 9 fouls on a team. This better prepares you to shoot 
				one &amp; one or two shots and be more ready to identify potential 
				shooters.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Some courts, George Stevens Academy being one, do not have 
				enough room in front of the scorer’s table for an “X” for subs 
				to report to. Therefore, substitutes will wait at the side of 
				the table to be beckoned into the game.</li>
